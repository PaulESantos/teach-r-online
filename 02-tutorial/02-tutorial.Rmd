## Activity 

**TO DO: UPDATE**

.hand[while we wait to get started...]

- Go to [INSERT LINK](INSERT LINK)
- Start working through the tutorial
- Feel free to make mistakes and test out the feedback
- If you get to the very end, follow the instructions (but if they seem a bit opaque, don't fret, we'll say more about "submission" later...)

---

.huge-text[you...]

- know and teach R

## Nudging

.hand-blue[Not all feedback is useful, at least not for beginners...]

<br>

Providing helpful feedback can help them nudge them towards success:

```{r eval=FALSE}
mean[1]
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ui_oops("`mean` is a function and a function doesn't have elements that can be subsetted with square brackets.")
ui_info("`means` is the vector of sample means calculated earlier.")
```

.sample-question[
Visualise the relationship between city and highway mileage of cars from the `mpg` dataset, conditional on year of manufacture.
]

--
<br>
.sample-answer[
There is a strong, positive, linear relationship between the city and highway mileage of cars. Year does not seem to be related to either variable.
```{r message=FALSE, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=9, dpi=300, out.width="70%"}
ggplot(mpg,aes(x = hwy, y = cty, fill=year)) +geom_point()+geom_smooth()
```
]

---

class: middle

.pull-left-wide[
.sample-feedback[
- You mention a linear relationship, however your plot uses a loess fit to visualise the relationship between city and highway mileage. Also, the plot displays the uncertainty around the fit, but you haven't addressed it in your narrative.
- Year should be mapped to the `color` aesthetic, not `fill`. 
- Plot styling: Use informative axis labels, noting units of measurement. Also, give an informative title to your plot.
- Code styling: Use consistent spacing around operators (e.g ` = `) and line breaks after `+` in each layer of your ggplot.

## Scaling

.hand-blue[Our courses are growing, and that's a good thing, right?]

--

- Students turning in their work as R Markdown documents makes collecting submissions including code and narrative straightforward.

--

- Providing feedback on both the code and narrative is not scalable unless (human) resources dedicated to your course grow proportionally with enrolments.

## `r emo::ji("package")` learnr

- **learnr** is an R package that makes it easy to create interactive tutorials from R Markdown documents.

- Tutorials can include:
  - Narrative, figures, illustrations, and equations
  - Code exercises (R code chunks that users can edit and execute directly)
  - Multiple choice questions
  - Videos (YouTube, Vimeo)
  - Interactive Shiny components

- learnr is on CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("learnr")
```

## `r emo::ji("package")` gradethis

- Companion to the learnr package, **gradethis** provides multiple methods to grade learnr exercises:
  - `grade_code()`: Grade code against a solution
  - `grade_conditions()`: Grade all specified conditions
  - `grade_result()`: Grade result of exercise code

- gradethis is not yet on CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/gradethis")
```

## Best practices for automated feedback

--

- Measure twice, cut once (verify the correctness of your tests) üìèüìè ‚úÇÔ∏è

--

- Use rounding & type coercion to write robust tests üí™

--

- Use hashing to hide solutions for visible tests üïµÔ∏è

--

- Test your tests on the students compute environment üíª

--

- Abstract your tests to a script that is sourced/imported into the students literate code document üìÅ

--

- Don't give automated feedback on everything üôà

--

- Consider peer feedback where automated feedback is not feasible (e.g. interpretation, narrative) but scalability is an issue üëØ

.huge-text[faq]

.large[
.hand-blue[Q: What is an approachable way to get started?]
]

Build a tutorial where students build develop their analysis in exercise code 
chunks (that are not checked) and only multiple choice questions are used for 
assessment. [**`[example]`**](https://minecr.shinyapps.io/04-wrangleviz)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="85%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/learnr-simple.png")
```

---

.large[
.hand-blue[Q: Is it possible to record student data?]
]

Yes, though not trivial, at this point. See [recording events](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/publishing.html#Recording_Events) section on the learnr documentation and the [**submitter**](https://github.com/dtkaplan/submitr) package by Danny Kaplan.

A solution that may be "good enough" for formative exercises: embed a 
Google/Microsoft/etc. Form at the end and ask students to "sign in" their work.
**Tip:** Add a free-text question to this form where students reflect on the 
exercises they just completed, and you can easily capture and analyze. [**`[example]`**](https://minecr.shinyapps.io/04-wrangleviz/#section-finish-up)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/learnr-logging.png")
```

---

.large[
.hand-blue[Q: I've built simple tutorials already. How do I make the jump to code checking and providing automated feedback that is actually useful?]
]

- Replicate `gradethis::gradethis_demo()`, then make incremental changes
- Read the [Testing](https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html#test-tests) chapter in R Packages (Wickham and Bryan) 
- Also read the [Metaprogramming](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/metaprogramming.html) section in Advanced R (Wickham)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/learnr-learn-more.jpeg")
```
